                <i>THE OTHERWORDLY AURORA Borealis</i>, or the northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere
                —at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the 
                Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.

            <i>THE OTHERWORDLY AURORA Borealis</i>, or the northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere
            —at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the

            The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more 
            accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial
            scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution. Find your magnetic
            latitude on NOAA and here.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily 
            the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles
            interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are
            pleasant tempatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
